      <blockquote><h3>Although humanitarian assistance is based on needs, some crises receive much more attention and support than others. Why is one person’s suffering an international priority while another person’s suffering goes unnoticed?  Due to various reasons: a lack of geopolitical interest, political priorities, to zero media attention, many crises often go unnoticed. We designed this page to get everyone involved everywhere around the world, not just one specific area that gets the most media attention. By doing so, we hope that everyone can take their first step to bringing change in the world. </h3></blockquote> <h1> - The Spectacle Team </h1>
